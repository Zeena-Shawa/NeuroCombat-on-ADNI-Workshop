# NeuroCombat-on-ADNI-Workshop
Materials for the CMIC-DRC Workshop on multi-site harmonization in Python with neuroCombat applied to ADNI. The method was introduced in the paper “Harmonization of cortical thickness measurements across scanners and sites”  by Fontin et al. 

Please fork this repository or download all the files into one folder, in order to follow-along via the Jupyter Notebook during the session. 
After the session the sample data will be unavailable. If you would like access to this please contact me.

Special thanks to Beatrice Taylor, Cameron Shand, and Neil Oxtoby for their time and ADNI tips.
