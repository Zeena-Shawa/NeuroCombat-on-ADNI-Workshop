# NeuroCombat-on-ADNI-Workshop
Materials for the CMIC-DRC Workshop on multi-site harmonization in Python with neuroCombat applied to ADNI. The method was introduced in the paper “Harmonization of cortical thickness measurements across scanners and sites” by Fontin et al. The neuroCombat package can be found [here](https://github.com/Jfortin1/neuroCombat) and needs to be installed prior to this workshop. 

Please fork this repository or download all the files into one folder, in order to follow-along via the Jupyter Notebook during the session. 
After the session the sample data will be unavailable. If you would like access to this please contact me. Alternatively, if you already have access to ADNI, then please download the merged data file which is the data used in this workshop. Just make sure to update the file name accordingly in the Jupyter notebook.  

Special thanks to Beatrice Taylor, Cameron Shand, and Neil Oxtoby for their time and ADNI tips.
